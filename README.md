ðŸ¤– AI Portfolio Analyzer

A production-ready API that analyzes stock portfolios using real-time financial data and generative AI, complete with MLOps tracking and containerization.

This project is an end-to-end machine learning application that:

Accepts a list of stock tickers (e.g., ["MSFT", "GOOG"]) via a REST API.

Fetches the latest 5-day stock data from the Alpha Vantage API.

Sends this financial data to the Google Gemini API for a detailed, human-like analysis.

Logs the entire interaction (data, prompt, and LLM response) to Weights & Biases (W&B) for MLOps tracking and debugging.

Returns the AI-generated analysis to the user as a JSON response.

The entire application is containerized with Docker for complete reproducibility and is ready for cloud deployment.

ðŸš€ How to Run Locally

This project is built with Docker and can be run in two simple commands.

Prerequisites:

Docker Desktop installed and running.

Git installed.

1. Clone the Repository

git clone [https://github.com/atalay1/my_portfolio_analyzer.git](https://github.com/atalay1/my_portfolio_analyzer.git)
cd my_portfolio_analyzer


2. Create Your Secret Keys (.env file)

This project requires three API keys.

Copy the example file:

cp .env.example .env


Edit the .env file and add your secret keys.

ALPHA_VANTAGE_KEY="your_key_here"
GEMINI_API_KEY="your_key_here"
WANDB_API_KEY="your_key_here"


3. Build the Docker Image

This command builds the container, installing all dependencies from the Dockerfile.

docker build -t portfolio-analyzer .


4. Run the Container

This command runs the container and securely passes in your secret keys from the .env file.

docker run -p 8000:8000 \
  --env-file ./.env \
  --name portfolio-api \
  -d portfolio-analyzer


(Note: --env-file ./.env is a clean way to pass all your keys at once instead of multiple -e flags.)

ðŸ”¬ How to Use the API

The API is now running on your machine. You can access the interactive documentation (powered by FastAPI) by going to:

http://localhost:8000/docs

From here, you can test the /analyze endpoint directly in your browser.

API Endpoint: /analyze

Method: POST

Body (JSON):

{
  "tickers": ["IBM", "MSFT",DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME="portfolio-analyzer" "GOOG"]
}

ðŸ“ˆ MLOps & Experiment Tracking

A key feature of this "production-ready" project is that every single API call is tracked using Weights & Biases.

This allows us to monitor and debug our LLM prompts and responses in real-time. We log a W&B Table for each analysis, capturing the input data, the exact prompt, and the model's response.
